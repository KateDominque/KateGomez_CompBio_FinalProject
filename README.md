DATA file
This folder contains material in forms of .png and .xlxs. The .png files shows F1 June and July oyster spawns plot figures of the data. The .xlxs files shows the raw data used to make the figures and charts. 

Rmd File
This file contains the r markdown code used for this project. First couple of scripts of the code - lines 20 through 60, describes the results of F1 June spawn. This was a smaller spawn of a 6x6 population cross. We noticed higher rate of fertilization occuring with the natural populations (NN, SS) compared to the hybrid populations (NS, SN). This can due to poor genetic compatability between the hybrids. 

F1 July spawn r script occurs from lines 62 through 83 in the r markdown sheet. These lines of code are replicated from what was used for the F1 June spawn code, the goal was to keep lines of code replicatable as well. Therefore, we succeeded in replication of code to this chunk of data. What we gathered from the results from this spawn was more varied results. This was a bigger spawn, with 36 crosses in total. Hybrid population SN resulted in more varied yet successful fertilization rates comapred to NS populations, this is a very unique finding. We also noticed a varied fertilization success in the natural populations, NN and SS. The NS hybrid population showed the lowest success of fertilization rates, this could be due to poor gentic compatability.

The rest of the r code lines in this markdown, was combining all of our cleaned results and combining these two plot charts into one figure. Then we continued to make this more visually pleasing by creating a boxplot of both F1 June and July spawn data. 

Hybrid_F1_Spawn.Rmd contains the r script used for this project.
